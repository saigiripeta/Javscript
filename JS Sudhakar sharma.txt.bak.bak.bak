JavaScript Sudhakar Shrama 
--------------------------

Day 1:
======
Javascript is lightWeight Interpretted and just in time Compiled Programming language.


1)Light Weight refers to memory occupied and how heavy the application is.

2)Interpretted refers to line by line translation or Execution.

3)Compiled referes to Translating entire program, all lines of program are translated simultaneously at the same time .

a) JIT 
b) AOT

JIT [JUST IN TIME] :-
----------------------
is the process where javascript is loaded into browser and compiled in the browser. But not compile in the application level.

AOT [AHEAD OF TIME] :-
----------------------
Is the process where javascript is compiled and processed at application level . And also send the result to the Browser and it will decrese the Burden on the Browser.


a)More faster .
b)More Better in  Performance .
c)And It will Reduce the Budern on the Browser And it will increase the javascript applications.


We can use Various Engines and Compilers.

             a)IVY (engine)
	     b)Babel (compiler)


-Javascript is a language which is used 

a)Clinet side      :With Html, React , Angular.
b)server side      :Node js .
c)Database         : Mongo DB.
d)Animation        : Flash , 3Ds Max.

-Javascripts Supports various Programming techniques and approaches
a)structral programming
b)Functional
c)Imperative 
d)OOPs 

-Javscript is not an oop language , It supports only few Features of OOP.

Evolution Of Js
-1990's Tim Berners Lee Introduced Introduced HTML and Web.
-1990's early browser were Mosiac(1), Netscape(2).
-These browsers used  Html as Markup language and ECMA script as client side script.
 
-In early 1995 NetScape appointed "Brendan Eich" To develop script for Browser [MDN] Mozilla developer Network.

                      -ECMA  [European Computer Manufacturers Association]
		      -MDN   [Mozilla developer Network]

-First was named as "Moca" after that renamed as "LiveScript".
-Script belongs to Netscape.
-Netscape give the rights of mainating scripts to a company called 
"Sun Micro systems".
-Sun Micro System named the script as "Javascript".
-React  Mainatined( FB), Angular Mainatined (Google).
-2000 Netscape stopped it services, javascript was given to ECMA.
-2014 javascript.
-2015 ECMA version ES5 = ECMAScript 2015.
-Current latest version of js is "ECMA 2022".

=======================================END OF DAY ONE======================================================


Day 2:-
=======

SetUp Enviornment for javascript

1.Install "Node js " On Your PC

Node js         : Server side programmingg library.
Node compiler   : It is used to compile and run js Programs.
NPM             : Node package manager.
                  [YARN,COMPOSER, NuGeT].

1)What is Package Manager?
A) It is a software tool used by developers to install , update and remove libraries from project.

2)Check node js version
A)  node -v     version > 14
    npm -v      version > 6


3. Download and install VS code .
-Editor Provides an IDE [Integrated Developement Enviornmemnt].
-Build , Debug , Test , Deploy.

To see all Editors ==>    https://editorconfig.org/

4. Open vs code and install some Extenstions.
1)Live server
2)vs code icons


5) Set Up for a js Project

Add Followinf folders into project:-

a) public    : it is ude to Keep all static Resources      [html,images,text, pdf,ppt,docx,mp4].
b)src        :It is used to keep all the Dynamic resources [js, ts, css,sass ].


6) open Terminal in vs code [Terminal is command line to the Run commands].

>Run the command 

     >npm init   [-y]  ==> it is used to initilize the project  and it generates the package.json.
                          package.json is a file that contains the project meta data.

                  
It will give all sample Project   ==>    https://www.codeproject.com/


PMD it will analyzie our code    ===>  https://pmd.github.io/pmd/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html


ESlint it is the analyzie our js code   ===>   https://eslint.org/

Install ESLint Configuration . It is used to Verify the code and report the issues in code [issues relaetd to Coding standards].

JAVASCRIPT

-Javascript is used Client side with HTML.
-Javascript is used for 
                   a)DOM Manipulations.     [10:40]
		   -Adding Elements.
		   -Removing Elements
		   -Updating data into elements.


Performace in the Browser in the RealTime.


                   b)Handling Browser Objects
		    -Location
		    -navigator
		    -History
		    -Document
		    -Window

		    C)Cleint side Validations
		    -Verfiy user Input
		    -Ensure that Contradictionary (means expections data)and unauthorized data is not stored into database.
		    -reduce Burden of Server.

		


What are the issues with the javascript?
Ans) Javascript is not a strongly Typed Language.


    It is Called as Dynamic Typed .
   
      var age =23;
      age  ="john";   // valid 
      age = true      // valid

 -javascript is not implicitly strictly typed .  

 If any developer write the code without following the standards it will accepts . We have manually tell . By using the ESLint.


                    x = 10;   // valid 

without decleard a variable also. It is also valid.It is Bad Pratice.

-Javascript is not an OOP language.
              -Extensibility Isuues
	      -Code level Security Issues
	      -Reusability Issues


-Javascript is not having features for dynamic Polymorphism.

-Javascript Can be disable by Browser.

Blocking the javascript in Our Browser .

We can test using the <noscript> Please allow the javascript</noscript> 

Q)What is the solution?
A) Typescript




Pratical Work  :-
==================

DOMContentLoaded()

Static Dom into Dynamic DOm

Q) How javscript Converts Static Dom Into Dynamic DOM?
A) By Integrating javascript functions into page.

Q) How javascript can be Integrated into page?
A) In the  THREE (3)different  ways .

     a)Inline 
     b)Embedded
     c)External file


                    Inline javascript 
                    -----------------
-In this Technique javascript functions are directly written in Html elements start Tag.

<button onClick="window.print()"> Print </button>


Advantage:-
-----------
-It is the faster In responding.


DrawBack:
--------
-It is not good for the reusability.





                     Embedded JS:
                     ------------
-Javascript functions are kept in a <script> Container And can be accessed from any element.

The script Container can be in <head> or <body>.
-you have to define functions in <script> Container.


Advantage :
----------
It is Resuable code .


DrawBack:
--------
It is slow when we compared to the Inline Js.
you can't re-use accross pages


<script>

     function PrintPage(){
     
     Window.print();
     }

</script>

<button onclick="printPage()"> Print page </button>



Q)What is diffrence Between script in head and Body?
A)Script Head section is intended to load browser memory and later accessed
by page when ever required.

Script in body section is intended to load into page directly, It is not in memory of browser.


      

=======================================END OF DAY Three======================================================


Day 4:-
-------



1.Javascript Inline
2.javascript Embedded

1) Where to embed in head or body?
2)What is The MIME type of script? MIME [Multi purpose Internet mail Extenstions]

A) javascript is used in various methods
                a)Interpretted
		b)Compiled

If your javascript is used with html in browser then MIME type is defined as "text/javascript"    - Interpretted

   "text/babel"         -javascript is used with babel compiler
   "text/module"        -Javscript Module system



   Syntax:
   -------
   <script type="text/javascript">  </script>
   <script type="text/babel">       </script>


Q) What is strict Mode for javascript?
A)javascript is not implicitly strictly typed.it will not follow programming rules and standars . you have to manually turn on "strict Mode".

If strict Mode is ON then developer have to write as per standards.

You can trun on strict mode by using "use strict" in your code snippet.



Q) How to target javascript for legacy browsers ? [Old version Browser]
A)Developer can target new javascript code to the legacy browser by enclosing the code in HTML comments.

Syntax;
-------
<script>
    // "use strict";
   <!-- x = 10;
    document.writeln(x); -->
</script>



                           External javascript
			   -------------------

Javascript functions are written in a seperate script file with ".js".

-you can link the script file to any html page by using <script> element.

Features :
----------
Clean Seperation of Code and design.
Hard to test it is embedded , [easy]
Hard to extend if it is embedded ,[easy]

Issue:
------
-using a external file for Html page will increse the number of requests.
If number of requests are increased for page , then the page load time will increase.
